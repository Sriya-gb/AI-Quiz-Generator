# **AI-Powered Quiz Generator**  

## **Project Overview**  
The AI-Powered Quiz Generator is a tool that automatically generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from any given text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI models. It extracts key information from the input text and formulates structured MCQs with:  
- One correct answer  
- Three incorrect but plausible distractors  

This project is designed for educators, students.
